# ipyxact
Python-based IP-XACT parser

ipyxact is a helper library that creates python structures from parsed IP-Xact files. It is intended to make it easier to use IP-Xact files in a python application

Also distributed with the source are some example applications to show how ipyxact can be used and an example IP-Xact component file (generic_example.xml).

`python gen_c_header.py *xml_file*` creates a C header file from the memory maps in *xml_file*

`python gen_markdown.py *xml_file*` creates markdown documentation of the memory maps in *xml_file*

`python print_filesets.py *xml_file*` creates a list of the verilog files found in the fileSets section of *xml_file*

ipyxact is compatible with Python >= 2.7
